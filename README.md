# djsonotron

Todo

- Move in the rest of the types.
- Write a test to verify the string & record test cases.

Then...

- Generate typescript definitions that I can use to define request/response API messages
- Generate parsing functions that I can use to parse inbound JSON payloads

And then...

- Ability to define an API surface (operations, inputs, outputs)
- Generate an oak-based web server scaffold
- Generate an OpenAPI compliant definition that is served by the web server

And finally...

- A utility that can parse an OpenAPI definition and create a fetch-based client that I'm happy with!
